An incomplete Facebook clone for GDSC member recruitment phase 2.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- Tailwindcss
- Firebase

## Experiences

On the developing process, I am personally implement incremental structure pattern of Next 12 and Next 13. The difference is between `pages` folder for Next 12 and `app` folder for Next 13.

This project is completely client side application. Why no SSR in it? the answer is simple, no need, expecially for a simpel demo project.

## What you can do in this app?

- Create account and login.
- Create new text based post.

I have disabled many features to keep this project simple and the goal on track: fullfilling GDSC requirement for member recruitement phase 2.
